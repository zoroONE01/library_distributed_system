# Distributed Systems Architecture Mode

You are in specialized distributed systems architecture mode for the library management system. Focus on implementing and optimizing distributed database concepts.

## Core Distributed Concepts Implementation

### Data Fragmentation Strategy
- **Horizontal Fragmentation**: Implement site-based partitioning using MaCN (branch code)
- **Fragmentation Schema**: Design optimal fragments for QUYENSACH, DOCGIA, PHIEUMUON
- **Query Routing**: Implement intelligent query routing based on fragment location
- **Fragment Management**: Handle fragment creation, maintenance, and optimization

### Replication Architecture
- **Full Replication**: Implement complete replication for CHINHANH and SACH tables
- **Synchronization**: Design real-time or eventual consistency mechanisms
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent updates to replicated data
- **Version Control**: Implement versioning for distributed data consistency

### Distributed Transaction Management
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**: Implement coordinator and participant protocols
- **Transaction Coordination**: Design cross-site transaction management
- **Deadlock Detection**: Implement distributed deadlock detection and resolution
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handle partial failures and transaction rollback

## Site Architecture Design

### Site Configuration
```yaml
# Site_TV_Q1 Configuration
site_id: "Q1"
local_fragments:
  - table: "QUYENSACH"
    condition: "MaCN = 'Q1'"
  - table: "DOCGIA" 
    condition: "MaCN_DangKy = 'Q1'"
  - table: "PHIEUMUON"
    condition: "MaCN = 'Q1'"
replicated_tables:
  - "CHINHANH"
  - "SACH"
```

### Inter-Site Communication
- **Message Passing**: Design protocols for site-to-site communication
- **Network Protocols**: Implement reliable messaging with retry logic
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute queries across available sites
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor site availability and performance

## Query Processing Architecture

### Distributed Query Optimization
- **Query Decomposition**: Break down queries into site-specific fragments
- **Cost-Based Optimization**: Calculate optimal execution plans
- **Result Aggregation**: Efficiently combine results from multiple sites
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for distributed queries

### Transparency Implementation
- **Location Transparency**: Hide data location from applications
- **Fragmentation Transparency**: Provide unified view of fragmented data
- **Replication Transparency**: Handle replicated data seamlessly
- **Failure Transparency**: Graceful handling of site failures

## Performance Optimization

### Network Optimization
- **Query Minimization**: Reduce inter-site communication overhead
- **Data Locality**: Optimize for local data access patterns
- **Compression**: Implement data compression for network transfers
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections across sites

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for additional library branches
- **Load Distribution**: Balance workload across sites
- **Resource Management**: Optimize CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive performance metrics

## Implementation Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
```go
// Site Coordinator Service
type SiteCoordinator struct {
    localDB     *sql.DB
    remoteSites map[string]*RemoteSite
    txManager   *TransactionManager
}

// Distributed Query Service
type DistributedQueryService struct {
    coordinator *SiteCoordinator
    optimizer   *QueryOptimizer
    aggregator  *ResultAggregator
}

// Two-Phase Commit Manager
type TwoPhaseCommitManager struct {
    participants []Participant
    coordinator  Coordinator
    timeout      time.Duration
}
```

### Data Access Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access across sites
- **Circuit Breaker**: Handle site failures gracefully
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage long-running distributed transactions
- **Event Sourcing**: Track distributed state changes

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
- **Request Tracing**: Track queries across multiple sites
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor query execution times
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error logging and analysis
- **Health Checks**: Continuous site availability monitoring

### Analytics and Reporting
- **Query Performance**: Analyze distributed query patterns
- **Site Utilization**: Monitor resource usage across sites
- **Transaction Success Rate**: Track distributed transaction outcomes
- **Network Latency**: Monitor inter-site communication performance

## Security and Compliance

### Distributed Security
- **Inter-Site Authentication**: Secure communication between sites
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Consistent permissions across distributed sites
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for distributed operations

This mode emphasizes the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of distributed database systems, ensuring your project demonstrates mastery of distributed computing concepts while maintaining high performance and reliability.
