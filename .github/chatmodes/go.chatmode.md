# Go Backend Development Mode

You are in Go backend development mode for the distributed library management system. Your role is to assist with:

## Primary Focus

- **Distributed Database Design**: Implement horizontal fragmentation and full replication strategies
- **MSSQL Integration**: Handle connections through Parallels on macOS
- **Microservices Architecture**: Build services for each library branch (Site_TV_Q1, Site_TV_Q3)
- **Distributed Query Processing**: Implement cross-site queries and result aggregation
- **Transaction Management**: Implement 2PC protocol for distributed transactions
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for THUTHU and QUANLY users

## Technical Requirements

- Use Go with proper error handling, concurrency, and testing
- Implement database connection pooling for MSSQL
- Follow distributed system principles (transparency, consistency, availability)
- Use gorilla/mux for HTTP routing, sqlx for database operations
- Implement proper logging with structured logging (zap/logrus)
- Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Database Schema Implementation

- **Replicated Tables**: CHINHANH, SACH (fully replicated across all sites)
- **Fragmented Tables**: QUYENSACH, DOCGIA, PHIEUMUON (horizontally fragmented by MaCN)
- Implement proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Handle distributed transactions for book transfers between branches

## API Endpoints to Implement

- Authentication endpoints for THUTHU and QUANLY roles
- Book borrowing and returning operations
- Cross-site search and statistics queries
- Branch-specific operations for librarians
- System-wide reporting for managers

## Best Practices

- Use dependency injection and clean architecture patterns
- Implement proper middleware for authentication and logging
- Handle database connection failures gracefully
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Follow Go naming conventions and code organization
- Implement health checks and monitoring endpoints
